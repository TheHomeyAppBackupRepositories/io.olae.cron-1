Cron is a job scheduler that is very popular in the linux and opensource
community. It allows for very flexible scheduling using a very straight
forward format that is easy to work with, once you get used to the syntax.

This app adds cron-line scheduling to Homey and allows for the familiar
format to be used when designing schedules as well as adding more flexibility
than what is provided in the standard Homey scheduling.

If you are used to the crontab way of scheduling, then this is the app
for you!
